\section{Coverage}
\label{sec:cov}
\textit{The Dean feels that it is not economically justified to by a robot system for 80.000 euro just to collect cups. Hence, it is interesting to have the robot do a second task, namely washing of the floors. Therefore calculate a coverage path that covers most of the floor in the map. Again the robot must start and end at the offloading stations.Again, you are free to choose algorithm and you should document the choice, the distance in kilometres that the robot moves and how long it takes to compute the coverage path.}
